oh hush my dear, it's been a difficult year
and terrors don't prey on innocent victims
trust me, darling
trust me, darling

it's been a loveless year
i'm a man of three fears
integrity, faith and crocodile tears
trust me, darling
trust me, darling

so look me in the eyes
tell me what you see
perfect paradise
tearing at the seams
i wish i could escape
i don't wanna fake it
wish i could erase it
make your heart believe
but i'm a bad liar
bad liar
now you know
now you know
i'm a bad liar
bad liar
now you know, you're free to go
did all my dreams never mean one thing
does happiness lie in a diamond ring
oh, i've been asking
oh, i've been asking for problems, problems, problems
i wage my war, on the world inside
i take my gun to the enemy's side
oh, i've been asking for
oh, i've been asking for problems, problems, problems
so look me in the eyes
tell me what you see
perfect paradise
tearing at the seams
i wish i could escape
i don't wanna fake it
wish i could erase it
make your heart believe
but i'm a bad liar
bad liar
now you know
now you know
that i'm a bad liar
bad liar
now you know, you're free to go
i can't breathe
i can't be
i can't be what you want me to be
believe me, this one time
believe me
i'm a bad liar
bad liar
now you know
now you know
that i'm a bad liar
bad liar
now you know, you're free to go

please believe me
please believe me
