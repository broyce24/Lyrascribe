just a small town girl
living in a lonely world
she took the midnight train going anywhere
just a city boy
born and raised in south detroit
he took the midnight train going anywhere

a singer in a smokey room
a smell of wine and cheap perfume
for a smile they can share the night
it goes on and on and on and on
strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding, somewhere in the night

working hard to get my fill
everybody wants a thrill
paying anything to roll the dice
just one more time
some'll win, some will lose
some are born to sing the blues
whoa the movie never ends
it goes on and on and on and on
strangers waiting
up and down the boulevard
their shadows searching in the night
streetlights, people
living just to find emotion
hiding somewhere in the night

don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
don't stop believing
hold on
streetlights, people
don't stop believing
hold on to that feeling
streetlights, people
