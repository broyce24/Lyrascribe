you have my heart
we'll never be worlds apart
maybe in magazines
but you'll still be my star
baby cause in the dark
you can't see shiny cars
and that's when you need me there
with you I'll always share
because
when the sun shine, we shine together
told you I'll be here forever
said I'll always be your friend
took an oath and I'm stick it out till the end
now that it's raining more than ever
know that we still have each other
you can stand under my umbrella
you can stand under my umbrella
