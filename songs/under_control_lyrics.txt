i might be anyone
a lone fool out in the sun
your heartbeat of solid gold
i love you, you'll never know
when the daylight comes you feel so cold
you know
i'm too afraid of my heart to let you go
waiting for the fire to light
feeling like we could do right
be the one that makes your night
cause freedom is a lonely road
we're under control

we're under control
